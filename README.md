# Netflix meets Tailwind 

Netflix clone that uses the TMDB API to fetch movies and tv shows. It also uses the Youtube API to fetch trailers for the movies and tv shows. ðŸš€

Hobby project for advancing my React skills and my first real React project, added my own twist to certain elements but overall tried to mimic the Netflix UI as much as possible.

Bootstrapped with create-react-app and tailwindcss.

To deploy the project:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build`

## API Keys ðŸ”‘

You will need to create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=

REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=n
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
